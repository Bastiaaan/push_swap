This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by brogaar

# Description
Sorting a stack of arbitrary numbers given via user input into an ascending order, two stacks were used for the operation.
This project's purpose was designed to gain understanding and experience with working with algorithms and linked lists. Turk-sort was the used algorithm due to its efficiency.
During runtime, the output is filled with commands such as: pa, ra, rra, sa, pb, rb, rrb, sb, rr, rrr and ss followed by a new line each.

# Instructions
For the compilation of this project, open the terminal and redirect to the path where the source code is located. Once on the correct path, execute *make* to compile all the source files. In order to run the program, execute *./push_swap.a [numbers]* with a random amount of numbers.
After use of the program, to clean up excessive files or after editing the source code, use *make clean* or *make fclean* to remove the compiled files.
