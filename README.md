# push_swap.c

This is a console runned program with the purpose of sorting an arbitrary array of numbers, given by user input via the console in an ascending order. 

# techniques

Almost all files contain C- and header files and the only extended functions used are malloc() and free(). 
For compiling the source code and other handmade libraries, Makefile files were used. 

# includes

<stdlib.h>: The source code of malloc() and free() to allocate the necessary amount of bytes and memory erasure respectively.
<stddef.h>: Declaration of specific types such as size_t.
<libft.h>: A library with 
<ft_printf.h>:
